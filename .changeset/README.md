# Changesets

Hello and welcome! This folder has been automatically generated by `@changesets/cli`, a build tool that works
with multi-package repos, or single-package repos to help you version and publish your code. You can
find the full documentation for it [in our repository](https://github.com/changesets/changesets)

We have a quick list of common questions to get you started engaging with this project in
[our documentation](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/blob/main/docs/common-questions.md)

## Release Process

This project uses Changesets for automated dual-package releases to both NPM and Crates.io.

### Creating a changeset

When you make changes that affect the published package, create a changeset:

```bash
pnpm changeset
```

Follow the prompts to:
1. Select the type of change (patch, minor, major)
2. Describe the changes for the changelog

### Automated release workflow

The release process is fully automated via GitHub Actions:

1. **Create changeset** → Push changes with changeset files
2. **Version PR** → GitHub Actions automatically creates a PR with version bumps and changelog updates
3. **Review & merge** → Review the generated changelog and version changes
4. **Publish** → After merging, packages are automatically published to:
   - NPM: `gh-labeler` package
   - Crates.io: `gh-labeler` crate

### Manual commands

```bash
# Check changeset status
pnpm changeset status

# Preview version changes (dry run)
pnpm changeset version --dry-run

# Test publishing (dry run)
pnpm run release:dry-run
```

### GitHub Actions dry run

You can test the release workflow without publishing:
1. Go to Actions tab → Release workflow
2. Click "Run workflow" → Set "dry_run: true"

The automated system ensures both NPM and Rust packages stay synchronized with identical version numbers and changelogs.
